# CodSoft Data Science Internship - Task 1  
## Titanic Survival Prediction  

### 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic survived based on features like:
- Passenger Class
- Sex
- Age
- Fare

We used **Logistic Regression** to train a model on the Titanic dataset.

---

### 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. **Loaded dataset** from CSV file  
2. **Cleaned data** (handled missing values, converted categorical variables)  
3. **Trained Logistic Regression model**  
4. **Evaluated model accuracy** (≈ 80%)  
5. **Tested with sample passenger** for survival prediction

---

### 📊 Accuracy
Model achieved an accuracy of around **80%** on the test dataset.

---

### 🔍 Prediction Example
Sample Passenger:  
- Pclass = 2  
- Sex = Female  
- Age = 25  
- Fare = 50  

**Prediction:** Survived ✅
