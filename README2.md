# CodSoft Data Science Internship - Task 2  
## Movie Rating Prediction  

### 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts the rating of a movie based on features like:
- Genre  
- Director  
- Actors  

We used **Linear Regression** on the IMDb Movies India dataset to estimate movie ratings.

### 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. **Loaded dataset** from CSV file  
2. **Cleaned and combined actor columns** into a single column  
3. **Encoded categorical variables** (Genre, Director, Actors) using Label Encoding  
4. **Trained Linear Regression model**  
5. **Evaluated model performance** (Mean Squared Error ≈ 1.81)  
6. **Tested with sample movie** for rating prediction

---

### 📊 Performance
- **Mean Squared Error:** 1.81  
- **Predicted Rating Example:** ~5.55 for sample movie
