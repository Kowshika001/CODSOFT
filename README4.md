### 📌 Project Overview
This project predicts sales based on advertising spend on:
- TV  
- Radio  
- Newspaper  

We used **Linear Regression** to model the relationship.

### 🛠️ Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored dataset  
2. Trained Linear Regression model  
3. Achieved **R² Score = 0.91**  
4. Predicted sales for custom ad spend example

### 📊 Performance
- **Mean Squared Error:** 2.91  
- **R² Score:** 0.91  
- **Prediction Example:** TV=150, Radio=30, Newspaper=20 → Sales ≈ 16.01
